## Requirements

- macOS Ventura (13) or later
- **Cloud TTS:** a free [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io) and API key
- **Local TTS:** Apple Silicon (M1 or later) — Python is downloaded automatically if needed

## Installation

1. [Download the repository](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it
2. Double-click **`install.command`**
3. Click **Continue**, then choose your backend: **ElevenLabs Only**, **Both** (recommended), or **Local Only** (Apple Silicon only)
4. Paste your API key if prompted
5. Click **Install** when prompted about the settings app — this adds the menu bar icon and registers `⌥⇧/` as a global hotkey

Choosing **Both** or **Local Only** on Apple Silicon installs mlx-audio + Kokoro for free offline TTS.

> **Getting your API key:** sign in at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) → click your profile icon → **Profile + API Key** → create or copy a key. The key needs the **Text-to-Speech** and **User Read** permissions enabled (User Read lets the menu bar show your remaining credits).

> **Local TTS note:** if no Python 3.10+ is found on your system, a standalone Python (~17 MB) is downloaded automatically. The Kokoro voice model (~350 MB) is also downloaded during installation.

### First use

Once installed, the **waveform icon** appears in your menu bar. On first launch the app will ask for Accessibility permission — click **Allow** so it can register the global hotkey.

- **Select any text** in any app → press `⌥⇧/` → audio plays
- **Press `⌥⇧/` again** while audio is playing → stops immediately

The waveform icon pulses while audio is being generated and played, so you always know it's working.

Your API key is stored in your macOS Keychain — never written to a file.

## Settings

Click the **waveform icon** in the menu bar. The menu adapts to your setup — you only see settings that apply. Use the **Backend** submenu to switch between **Auto** (cloud + local fallback), **ElevenLabs** (cloud only), and **Local** (offline only).

### ElevenLabs settings

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Voice** | Popular presets or a custom voice ID |
| **Model** | v3 · Flash v2.5 · Turbo v2.5 · Multilingual v2 |
| **Speed** | 0.7× to 1.2× |
| **Stability** | 0.0 (expressive) to 1.0 (steady) — controls pitch and pacing variation |
| **Similarity** | 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high) — how closely output matches the original voice |
| **Style** | 0.0 (none) to 1.0 (max) — amplifies the voice's characteristic delivery; adds latency |
| **Speaker Boost** | On / Off — subtle enhancement to voice similarity |

### Local (Kokoro) settings

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Voice** | 12 curated English voices (American and British) |
| **Speed** | 0.5× to 2× |

Settings take effect immediately — no restart needed.

### ElevenLabs voices

| Name | Style |
|------|-------|
| Lily | British, raspy |
| Alice | British, confident |
| Rachel | Calm |
| Adam | Deep |
| Domi | Strong |
| Josh | Young, deep |
| Sam | Raspy |

You can also enter any voice ID from the [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) via **Voice → Custom voice ID…** in the menu.

### Kokoro voices

| Name | Style |
|------|-------|
| Lily | British, bright (default) |
| Heart | Warm |
| Bella | Soft |
| Nova | Confident |
| Sarah | Gentle |
| Sky | Bright |
| Adam | Deep |
| Echo | Clear |
| Eric | Steady |
| Michael | Warm |
| Emma | British, warm |
| George | British, deep |

## Uninstall

Double-click **`uninstall.command`** — it removes everything including the Accessibility permission, login item, API key, and app bundle.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `⌥⇧/` does nothing | Grant Accessibility permission when prompted, or check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility |
| Waveform icon not in menu bar | Open `~/Applications/Speak11 Settings.app` manually, or re-run `install.command` |
| HTTP 401 | API key is wrong or expired — run `install.command` again |
| HTTP 429 | Monthly character quota exceeded — if both backends are installed, the app automatically falls back to local TTS. On Apple Silicon with ElevenLabs only, it will offer to install local TTS as a free alternative |
| "python3 not found" | Run `xcode-select --install` in Terminal |
| Local TTS is slow | Check `~/.local/share/speak11/tts.log` for errors. The TTS daemon keeps the model loaded and warmed up in memory so requests are near-instant |

## Cost

**ElevenLabs:** the free tier includes a monthly character allowance — usually sufficient for casual read-aloud use. Paid plans start at $5/month. See [elevenlabs.io/pricing](https://elevenlabs.io/pricing).

**Local (Kokoro):** completely free. Runs on your Mac with no API calls or credits. Requires Apple Silicon and a one-time ~350 MB model download.

### Config file

Settings are saved to `~/.config/speak11/config`. You can edit this file directly:

```bash
TTS_BACKEND="auto"
TTS_BACKENDS_INSTALLED="both"
VOICE_ID="pFZP5JQG7iQjIQuC4Bku"
MODEL_ID="eleven_flash_v2_5"
STABILITY="0.50"
SIMILARITY_BOOST="0.75"
STYLE="0.00"
USE_SPEAKER_BOOST="true"
SPEED="1.00"
LOCAL_VOICE="bf_lily"
LOCAL_SPEED="1.00"
```

### Environment variables

Environment variables take highest priority and override both the config file and the settings app:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key"       # overrides Keychain
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID="your-voice-id"
export ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID="eleven_multilingual_v2"
export TTS_BACKEND="local"                     # "auto" (default), "elevenlabs", or "local"
export LOCAL_VOICE="am_adam"                   # Kokoro voice ID
export LOCAL_SPEED="1.25"                      # 0.5 to 2.0
export SPEAK11_IDLE_TIMEOUT="600"              # daemon idle shutdown (seconds, default 300)
```

### Voice IDs

| Name | ID |
|------|----|
| Lily | `pFZP5JQG7iQjIQuC4Bku` |
| Alice | `Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2` |
| Rachel | `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` |
| Adam | `pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB` |
| Domi | `AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld` |
| Josh | `TxGEqnHWrfWFTfGW9XjX` |
| Sam | `yoZ06aMxZJJ28mfd3POQ` |

### Accessibility permission

The global hotkey requires Accessibility access. The app prompts for this on first launch, but if you need to grant it manually:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** → enable **Speak11 Settings**

The hotkey activates automatically once access is granted.

### Electron apps (Beeper, Slack, VS Code, etc.)

Electron apps intercept keyboard shortcuts before macOS Services sees them. The settings app solves this by registering `⌥⇧/` as a **global hotkey** via CoreGraphics — it works at the system level and cannot be blocked by any app.

The settings app simulates `⌘C` via CGEvent to copy the current selection before calling the TTS script, so the hotkey works everywhere — including apps that don't support macOS Services.

### Optional: Services shortcut

The installer also creates a macOS Services action you can bind to any shortcut. This is optional — `⌥⇧/` already works everywhere — but useful if you prefer a different key combination.

1. System Settings → **Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Services → Text**
2. Find **Speak Selection** and assign a shortcut — e.g. `⌃⌥S`

> **Speak Selection** not in the list? Log out and back in, or trigger via right-click → **Services**.

### TTS daemon

Local TTS uses a persistent daemon (`tts_server.py`) that keeps the Kokoro model loaded in memory. The daemon starts automatically on first local TTS request and shuts down after 5 minutes of inactivity. When the Settings app is running, it manages the daemon directly.

Logs are written to `~/.local/share/speak11/tts.log`.

### Updating

Pull the latest changes — the symlink means `~/.local/bin/speak.sh` always reflects the current repo file, so no extra steps needed.

To update your API key, run `install.command` again — or update it directly:

```bash
security add-generic-password \
  -a "speak11" \
  -s "speak11-api-key" \
  -w "your-new-key" \
  -U
```
